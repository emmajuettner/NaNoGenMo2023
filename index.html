        <h1>The Forgotten Clue</h1>
        <h2>a <a href="https://github.com/emmajuettner/NaNoGenMo2023">procedural mystery</a></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>It was a bright and stormy Sunday. </p><p>Six visitors had come to Boddy Manor by express invitation of its owner, Mr Boddy.</p><p>Miss Scarlett was singularly attractive.</p><p>Professor Plum was quite an adroit flatterer.</p><p>Colonel Mustard was as beautiful as any poem.</p><p>Mr Green was entirely free from all personal bitterness.</p><p>Mrs Peacock was above the meanness of tale-bearing.</p><p>Mrs White was a genuine human being.</p><p>All were much piqued when, upon arriving, they found their host murdered. Each began to suspect the others, and quickly they began to search the house for clues.</p><hr>
<p>Eager for the fray, Miss Scarlett stepped into the conservatory.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Miss Scarlett called Colonel Mustard into the conservatory.</p><p>Miss Scarlett said, "Colonel Mustard, the apparently inevitable conclusion is that it was Mrs Peacock in the conservatory with the lead pipe!"</p><p>In the worst possible temper, Colonel Mustard answered, "That is too transparently foolish to fool anybody. Clearly the murder weapon isn't the lead pipe. The cause of death was not a blunt object."</p><p>"Oh," Miss Scarlett said. "The horrible consciousness has just dawned upon me that I may be mistaken."</p><hr>
<p>With stoical calm, Professor Plum stepped into the study.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Professor Plum called Mrs Peacock into the study.</p><p>Professor Plum said, "Mrs Peacock, I feel confident that it was Miss Scarlett in the study with the lead pipe!"</p><p>Yielding to a passing impulse, Mrs Peacock replied, "That has caused me a thousand apprehensions."</p><hr>
<p>Full of high spirits, Colonel Mustard stepped into the lounge.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Colonel Mustard called Mrs White into the lounge.</p><p>Colonel Mustard said, "Mrs White, it is a matter of common knowledge that it was Professor Plum in the lounge with the lead pipe!"</p><p>With unquestioning faith, Mrs White replied, "I wish to give my hearty endorsement to that theory."</p><hr>
<p>With remarkable equanimity, Mr Green stepped into the billiard room.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Mr Green called Miss Scarlett into the billiard room.</p><p>Mr Green said, "Miss Scarlett, the results are everywhere apparent: it was Mrs White in the billiard room with the wrench!"</p><p>Irritably self-conscious, Miss Scarlett answered, "You are certainly not making a reputation for accuracy by some of your statements. Obviously the murder weapon isn't the wrench. The cause of death was not a blunt object."</p><p>"Oh," Mr Green said. "Owing to a foolish error, I was mistaken."</p><hr>
<p>Full of business, Mrs Peacock stepped into the library.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Mrs Peacock called Colonel Mustard into the library.</p><p>Mrs Peacock said, "Colonel Mustard, the results are everywhere apparent: it was you in the library with the candlestick!"</p><p>In the worst possible temper, Colonel Mustard answered, "No intelligent man can afford to disregard that the murder weapon isn't the candlestick. The cause of death was not a blunt object."</p><p>"Oh," Mrs Peacock said. "I should not have intruded on you at this hour."</p><p>Colonel Mustard shot Mrs Peacock an accusing look.</p><hr>
<p>With remarkable equanimity, Mrs White stepped into the dining room.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Mrs White called Colonel Mustard into the dining room.</p><p>Mrs White said, "Colonel Mustard, I am told by persons considering themselves sagacious in business that it was Professor Plum in the dining room with the knife!"</p><p>With unquestioning faith, Colonel Mustard replied, "I compliment you on your good sense."</p><hr>
<p>Without the flick of an eyelid, Miss Scarlett stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Miss Scarlett called Colonel Mustard into the kitchen.</p><p>Miss Scarlett said, "Colonel Mustard, it has been avouched again and again that it was Professor Plum in the kitchen with the wrench!"</p><p>In crass ignorance, Colonel Mustard replied, "I admire your foresight."</p><hr>
<p>Without the flick of an eyelid, Professor Plum stepped into the hall.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Professor Plum called Mr Green into the hall.</p><p>Professor Plum said, "Mr Green, it is highly probable that it was Miss Scarlett in the hall with the knife!"</p><p>Sorely tired, Mr Green answered, "It is well within the bounds of conservative statement to say that it wasn't Miss Scarlett. Miss Scarlett  was with me at the time!"</p><p>"Oh," Professor Plum said. "In an unguarded moment, I erred."</p><hr>
<p>With stoical calm, Colonel Mustard stepped into the ballroom.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Colonel Mustard called Mrs Peacock into the ballroom.</p><p>Colonel Mustard said, "Mrs Peacock, unreservedly, unequivocally, and absolutely, it was me in the ballroom with the knife!"</p><p>Irritably self-conscious, Mrs Peacock answered, "A conclusion not to be accepted without long deliberation. For the murder weapon isn't the knife. There was no blood!"</p><p>"Oh," Colonel Mustard said. "The horrible consciousness has just dawned upon me that I may be mistaken."</p><hr>
<p>With a fine swinging step, Mr Green stepped into the conservatory.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Mr Green called Mrs White into the conservatory.</p><p>Mr Green said, "Mrs White, it is self-evident that it was Colonel Mustard in the conservatory with the lead pipe!"</p><p>With a heart as heavy as lead, Mrs White answered, "You are certainly not making a reputation for accuracy by some of your statements. Obviously the murder couldn't have taken place in the conservatory. It would have taken far too much effort to move the body from there."</p><p>"Oh," Mr Green said. "I should not have intruded on you at this hour."</p><hr>
<p>With stoical calm, Mrs Peacock stepped into the lounge.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Mrs Peacock called Colonel Mustard into the lounge.</p><p>Mrs Peacock said, "Colonel Mustard, a reasonable inference is that it was Mrs White in the lounge with the revolver!"</p><p>With tender sensibility, Colonel Mustard replied, "That was splendid of you!"</p><hr>
<p>Alive as never before, Mrs White stepped into the dining room.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Mrs White called Mrs Peacock into the dining room.</p><p>Mrs White said, "Mrs Peacock, it has been avouched again and again that it was Colonel Mustard in the dining room with the wrench!"</p><p>Yielding to a passing impulse, Mrs Peacock replied, "I thoroughly agree with you."</p><hr>
<p>Alive as never before, Miss Scarlett stepped into the conservatory.</p><p>One other already occupied the room. Mr Green was muttering softly. </p><p>Miss Scarlett said, "Mr Green, the results are everywhere apparent: it was you in the conservatory with the candlestick!"</p><p>With tender sensibility, Mr Green replied, "I admire your foresight."</p><hr>
<p>With stoical calm, Professor Plum stepped into the conservatory.</p><p>Two others already occupied the room. Miss Scarlett was searching through bags of potting soil. Mr Green was watering the plants. </p><p>Professor Plum said, "Mr Green, I am left with no misapprehensions that it was you in the conservatory with the lead pipe!"</p><p>Yielding to a passing impulse, Mr Green replied, "That is a wholesome and heartening conviction."</p><hr>
<p>Eager for the fray, Colonel Mustard stepped into the ballroom.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Colonel Mustard called Mr Green into the ballroom.</p><p>Colonel Mustard said, "Mr Green, it is self-evident that it was you in the ballroom with the rope!"</p><p>In the worst possible temper, Mr Green answered, "I have carefully inquired into this matter and the murder couldn't have taken place in the ballroom. It would have taken far too much effort to move the body from there."</p><p>"Oh," Colonel Mustard said. "In an unguarded moment, I erred."</p><p>Mr Green shot Colonel Mustard an aggrieved look.</p><hr>
<p>With remarkable equanimity, Mr Green stepped into the dining room.</p><p>Two others already occupied the room. Mrs Peacock was rifling through the silverware. Mrs White was muttering softly. </p><p>Mr Green said, "Mrs White, it may be safely asserted that it was me in the dining room with the rope!"</p><p>With a suggestion of nervous tears, Mrs White answered, "This is not a wise course to follow. Clearly the murder couldn't have taken place in the dining room. That's not where the body was."</p><p>"Oh," Mr Green said. "In an unguarded moment, I erred."</p><hr>
<p>With remarkable equanimity, Mrs Peacock stepped into the ballroom.</p><p>One other already occupied the room. Colonel Mustard was standing indecisively near the doorway. </p><p>Mrs Peacock said, "Colonel Mustard, unreservedly, unequivocally, and absolutely, it was me in the ballroom with the knife!"</p><p>With tender sensibility, Colonel Mustard replied, "I am perfectly of that opinion."</p><hr>
<p>With a fine swinging step, Mrs White stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Mrs White called Colonel Mustard into the kitchen.</p><p>Mrs White said, "Colonel Mustard, it has become perfectly evident that it was Professor Plum in the kitchen with the revolver!"</p><p>With due consideration, Colonel Mustard replied, "I shall be extremely distressed if that is so."</p><hr>
<p>With an air of quiet, unaffected assurance, Miss Scarlett stepped into the ballroom.</p><p>One other already occupied the room. Mrs Peacock was standing indecisively near the doorway. </p><p>Miss Scarlett said, "Mrs Peacock, it requires no extraordinary perception to discern that it was you in the ballroom with the knife!"</p><p>In utter exasperation, Mrs Peacock answered, "No intelligent man can afford to disregard that the murder weapon isn't the knife. There was no blood!"</p><p>"Oh," Miss Scarlett said. "I am far from being as well informed as you suppose me to be."</p><p>Mrs Peacock shot Miss Scarlett an accusing look.</p><hr>
<p>Without the flick of an eyelid, Professor Plum stepped into the billiard room.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Professor Plum called Mrs White into the billiard room.</p><p>Professor Plum said, "Mrs White, I am living in the irresistible conviction that it was me in the billiard room with the wrench!"</p><p>In crass ignorance, Mrs White replied, "That is a proposal which shall meet with unanimous approbation."</p><hr>
<p>With the utmost composure, Colonel Mustard stepped into the study.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Colonel Mustard called Mr Green into the study.</p><p>Colonel Mustard said, "Mr Green, from that result there will be no dissent: it was me in the study with the knife!"</p><p>Sorely tired, Mr Green answered, "No intelligent man can afford to disregard that it wasn't Colonel Mustard. Colonel Mustard  wouldn't hurt a fly!"</p><p>"Oh," Colonel Mustard said. "In the exasperation of the moment, I erred."</p><hr>
<p>Quick in every part, Mr Green stepped into the billiard room.</p><p>Two others already occupied the room. Professor Plum was standing indecisively near the doorway. Mrs White was pacing back and forth. </p><p>Mr Green said, "Mrs White, beyond question, it was you in the billiard room with the revolver!"</p><p>Yielding to a passing impulse, Mrs White replied, "I compliment you on your good sense."</p><hr>

Mrs Peacock was searching through bags of potting soil. </p><p>Mrs White said, "Mrs Peacock, I lack words to express the full extent of my conviction that it was Miss Scarlett in the conservatory with the candlestick!"</p><p>Sorely tired, Mrs Peacock answered, "That was rather tall talk upon your part. Clearly the murder weapon isn't the candlestick. The cause of death was not a blunt object."</p><p>"Oh," Mrs White said. "If hearty sorrow be a sufficient ransom for offence, I tender’t here."</p><hr>
<p>Alive as never before, Miss Scarlett stepped into the dining room.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Miss Scarlett called Mr Green into the dining room.</p><p>Miss Scarlett said, "Mr Green, I am told by persons considering themselves sagacious in business that it was Mrs Peacock in the dining room with the revolver!"</p><p>With unquestioning faith, Mr Green replied, "On that issue you are splendidly right."</p><hr>
<p>With remarkable equanimity, Professor Plum stepped into the library.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Professor Plum called Colonel Mustard into the library.</p><p>Professor Plum said, "Colonel Mustard, at first sight it seems it was you in the library with the wrench!"</p><p>With tender sensibility, Colonel Mustard replied, "You have robbed me of my tranquillity."</p><hr>
<p>Without the flick of an eyelid, Colonel Mustard stepped into the hall.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Colonel Mustard called Miss Scarlett into the hall.</p><p>Colonel Mustard said, "Miss Scarlett, a mere cursory examination will make it clear that it was you in the hall with the wrench!"</p><p>With a heart as heavy as lead, Miss Scarlett answered, "No intelligent man can afford to disregard that the murder couldn't have taken place in the hall. It would have taken far too much effort to move the body from there."</p><p>"Oh," Colonel Mustard said. "I am far from being as well informed as you suppose me to be."</p><p>Miss Scarlett shot Colonel Mustard an accusing look.</p><hr>
<p>Ready in a trice, Mr Green stepped into the conservatory.</p><p>Two others already occupied the room. Mrs Peacock was humming a tune. Mrs White was sitting pensively. </p><p>Mr Green said, "Mrs White, I need not scruple to repeat my assertion: it was Miss Scarlett in the conservatory with the candlestick!"</p><p>With a suggestion of nervous tears, Mrs White answered, "This is not a wise course to follow.

<p>With an air of quiet, unaffected assurance, Miss Scarlett stepped into the dining room.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Miss Scarlett called Mrs White into the dining room.</p><p>Miss Scarlett said, "Mrs White, I shall not die happy unless it was Professor Plum in the dining room with the lead pipe!"</p><p>Sorely tired, Mrs White answered, "It is well within the bounds of conservative statement to say that the murder couldn't have taken place in the dining room. It would have taken far too much effort to move the body from there."</p><p>"Oh," Miss Scarlett said. "If hearty sorrow be a sufficient ransom for offence, I tender’t here."</p><hr>
<p>Full of business, Professor Plum stepped into the conservatory.</p><p>One other already occupied the room. Mr Green was muttering softly. </p><p>Professor Plum said, "Mr Green, the plain unvarnished fact is it was me in the conservatory with the knife!"</p><p>With tender sensibility, Mr Green replied, "That is a proposal which shall meet with unanimous approbation."</p><hr>

<p>Without the flick of an eyelid, Colonel Mustard stepped into the ballroom.</p><p>One other already occupied the room.

<p>With an air of quiet, unaffected assurance, Mr Green stepped into the conservatory.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Mr Green called Miss Scarlett into the conservatory.</p><p>Mr Green said, "Miss Scarlett, the clear upshot of it all is that it was Professor Plum in the conservatory with the knife!"</p><p>In crass ignorance, Miss Scarlett replied, "I am keenly interested in what you say."</p><hr>

<p>Working like mad, Mrs White stepped into the lounge.</p><p>One other already occupied the room.

"I offer my humblest apologies."</p><p>Professor Plum shot Mrs White an annoyed look.</p><hr>
<p>With remarkable equanimity, Miss Scarlett stepped into the lounge.</p><p>Two others already occupied the room. Professor Plum was pacing back and forth.

<p>Without the flick of an eyelid, Professor Plum stepped into the study.</p><p>One other already occupied the room.

<p>With stoical calm, Mr Green stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Mr Green called Colonel Mustard into the kitchen.</p><p>Mr Green said, "Colonel Mustard, it has been avouched again and again that it was Mrs Peacock in the kitchen with the candlestick!"</p><p>In utter exasperation, Colonel Mustard answered, "I have carefully inquired into this matter and the murder weapon isn't the candlestick. The cause of death was not a blunt object."</p><p>"Oh," Mr Green said. "If hearty sorrow be a sufficient ransom for offence, I tender’t here."</p><hr>
<p>Without the flick of an eyelid, Mrs Peacock stepped into the lounge.</p><p>One other already occupied the room.

<p>With remarkable equanimity, Professor Plum stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>One other already occupied the room.

<p>With stoical calm, Mr Green stepped into the billiard room.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Mr Green called Professor Plum into the billiard room.</p><p>Mr Green said, "Professor Plum, the fact is irrefutable that it was you in the billiard room with the revolver!"</p><p>Irritably self-conscious, Professor Plum answered, "You make unqualified assertions.

Mrs Peacock was muttering softly. </p><p>Mrs White said, "Mrs Peacock, nothing is more certified than that it was Professor Plum in the hall with the lead pipe!"</p><p>Irritably self-conscious, Mrs Peacock answered, "This is not a wise course to follow.

<p>With the utmost composure, Miss Scarlett stepped into the hall.</p><p>Four others already occupied the room. Professor Plum was humming a tune. Mr Green was humming a tune.

<p>Without the flick of an eyelid, Professor Plum stepped into the library.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Professor Plum called Mrs White into the library.</p><p>Professor Plum said, "Mrs White, there is nothing ambiguous about it: it was me in the library with the candlestick!"</p><p>With a heart as heavy as lead, Mrs White answered, "I have carefully inquired into this matter and the murder weapon isn't the candlestick.

<p>With more than a languid interest, Colonel Mustard stepped into the library.</p><p>Two others already occupied the room. Professor Plum was pacing back and forth.

<p>As full of fight as ever, Miss Scarlett stepped into the billiard room.</p><p>One other already occupied the room.

<p>Quick in every part, Professor Plum stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>Two others already occupied the room. Colonel Mustard was checking inside the cupboards. Mrs Peacock was humming a tune. </p><p>Professor Plum said, "Colonel Mustard, I am bold to aver that it was Miss Scarlett in the kitchen with the wrench!"</p><p>Irritably self-conscious, Colonel Mustard answered, "Ordinary prudence would suggest that the murder couldn't have taken place in the kitchen.

Obviously the murder weapon isn't the rope. There were no strangulation marks on the body."</p><p>"Oh," Colonel Mustard said. "In an evil hour, I erred."</p><p>Professor Plum shot Colonel Mustard an accusing look.</p><hr>
<p>With remarkable equanimity, Mr Green stepped into the library.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Mr Green called Colonel Mustard into the library.</p><p>Mr Green said, "Colonel Mustard, from that result there will be no dissent: it was you in the library with the knife!"</p><p>In utter exasperation, Colonel Mustard answered, "No intelligent man can afford to disregard that it wasn't Colonel Mustard. Colonel Mustard  wouldn't hurt a fly!"</p><p>"Oh," Mr Green said. "I offer my humblest apologies."</p><p>Colonel Mustard shot Mr Green an aggrieved look.</p><hr>
<p>As lively as a thrush, Mrs Peacock stepped into the study.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Mrs Peacock called Professor Plum into the study.</p><p>Mrs Peacock said, "Professor Plum, beyond question, it was Miss Scarlett in the study with the revolver!"</p><p>Thin-skinned in the presence of annoyances, Professor Plum answered, "No intelligent man can afford to disregard that it wasn't Miss Scarlett. Miss Scarlett  was with me at the time!"</p><p>"Oh," Mrs Peacock said. "In an unguarded moment, I erred."</p><hr>
<p>With remarkable equanimity, Mrs White stepped into the hall.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Mrs White called Professor Plum into the hall.</p><p>Mrs White said, "Professor Plum, I assert without fear of successful contradiction that it was you in the hall with the rope!"</p><p>In utter exasperation, Professor Plum answered, "The worst wheel always creaks most. Obviously the murder weapon isn't the rope. There were no strangulation marks on the body."</p><p>"Oh," Mrs White said. "In an evil hour, I erred."</p><p>Professor Plum shot Mrs White an angry look.</p><hr>
<p>With stoical calm, Miss Scarlett stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Miss Scarlett called Professor Plum into the kitchen.</p><p>Miss Scarlett said, "Professor Plum, it seems reasonably certain that it was Colonel Mustard in the kitchen with the candlestick!"</p><p>In utter exasperation, Professor Plum answered, "Ordinary prudence would suggest that it wasn't Colonel Mustard. Colonel Mustard  was with me at the time!"</p><p>"Oh," Miss Scarlett said. "I am far from being as well informed as you suppose me to be."</p><hr>
<p>As lively as a thrush, Professor Plum stepped into the lounge.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Professor Plum called Colonel Mustard into the lounge.</p><p>Professor Plum said, "Colonel Mustard, there is no vain assumption in saying that it was Miss Scarlett in the lounge with the knife!"</p><p>Irritably self-conscious, Colonel Mustard answered, "You are certainly not making a reputation for accuracy by some of your statements. Obviously the murder couldn't have taken place in the lounge. That's not where the body was."</p><p>"Oh," Professor Plum said. "In an evil hour, I erred."</p><hr>
<p>Eager for the fray, Colonel Mustard stepped into the library.</p><p>One other already occupied the room. Mr Green was humming a tune. </p><p>Colonel Mustard said, "Mr Green, it is a matter of the simplest demonstration that it was Miss Scarlett in the library with the lead pipe!"</p><p>Sorely tired, Mr Green answered, "No intelligent man can afford to disregard that it wasn't Miss Scarlett. Miss Scarlett  wouldn't hurt a fly!"</p><p>"Oh," Colonel Mustard said. "If hearty sorrow be a sufficient ransom for offence, I tender’t here."</p><hr>
<p>Tinglingly alive, Mr Green stepped into the study.</p><p>One other already occupied the room. Mrs Peacock was scribbling furiously in a notebook. </p><p>Mr Green said, "Mrs Peacock, the plain unvarnished fact is it was Mrs White in the study with the rope!"</p><p>In the worst possible temper, Mrs Peacock answered, "It is well within the bounds of conservative statement to say that the murder weapon isn't the rope. There were no strangulation marks on the body."</p><p>"Oh," Mr Green said. "In an evil hour, I erred."</p><hr>
<p>Tinglingly alive, Mrs Peacock stepped into the hall.</p><p>One other already occupied the room. Mrs White was standing indecisively near the doorway. </p><p>Mrs Peacock said, "Mrs White, it needs no great play of imagination to see that it was me in the hall with the revolver!"</p><p>Irritably self-conscious, Mrs White answered, "A conclusion not to be accepted without long deliberation. For it wasn't Mrs Peacock. Mrs Peacock  wouldn't hurt a fly!"</p><p>"Oh," Mrs Peacock said. "The horrible consciousness has just dawned upon me that I may be mistaken."</p><hr>
<p>Without the flick of an eyelid, Mrs White stepped into the billiard room.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Mrs White called Mr Green into the billiard room.</p><p>Mrs White said, "Mr Green, I feel called upon to asseverate that it was Professor Plum in the billiard room with the knife!"</p><p>Irritably self-conscious, Mr Green answered, "That was rather tall talk upon your part. Clearly the murder weapon isn't the knife. There was no blood!"</p><p>"Oh," Mrs White said. "In an evil hour, I erred."</p><hr>
<p>Teeming with life, Miss Scarlett stepped into the dining room.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Miss Scarlett called Mrs White into the dining room.</p><p>Miss Scarlett said, "Mrs White, I am more than convinced every day that it was me in the dining room with the candlestick!"</p><p>With a suggestion of nervous tears, Mrs White answered, "That was rather tall talk upon your part. Clearly the murder weapon isn't the candlestick. The cause of death was not a blunt object."</p><p>"Oh," Miss Scarlett said. "In an evil hour, I erred."</p><hr>
<p>Alive as never before, Professor Plum stepped into the library.</p><p>One other already occupied the room. Colonel Mustard was standing indecisively near the doorway. </p><p>Professor Plum said, "Colonel Mustard, the apparently inevitable conclusion is that it was Mrs White in the library with the knife!"</p><p>With tender sensibility, Colonel Mustard replied, "Truly, we are harried by uncertainties."</p><hr>
<p>Quick in every part, Colonel Mustard stepped into the conservatory.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Colonel Mustard called Professor Plum into the conservatory.</p><p>Colonel Mustard said, "Professor Plum, a mere cursory examination will make it clear that it was Mrs White in the conservatory with the revolver!"</p><p>Without the slightest friction, Professor Plum replied, "It is a capital piece of work."</p><hr>
<p>Without the flick of an eyelid, Mr Green stepped into the dining room.</p><p>Two others already occupied the room. Miss Scarlett was rifling through the silverware. Mrs White was muttering softly. </p><p>Mr Green said, "Miss Scarlett, the issue is clearly drawn: it was Mrs White in the dining room with the knife!"</p><p>With a heart as heavy as lead, Miss Scarlett answered, "It is well within the bounds of conservative statement to say that the murder weapon isn't the knife. There was no blood!"</p><p>"Oh," Mr Green said. "In an evil hour, I erred."</p><p>Mrs White shot Mr Green a defiant look.</p><hr>
<p>With stoical calm, Mrs Peacock stepped into the conservatory.</p><p>Two others already occupied the room. Professor Plum was searching through bags of potting soil. Colonel Mustard was searching through bags of potting soil. </p><p>Mrs Peacock said, "Professor Plum, the fact is irrefutable that it was Miss Scarlett in the conservatory with the knife!"</p><p>With a heart as heavy as lead, Professor Plum answered, "It is well within the bounds of conservative statement to say that it wasn't Miss Scarlett. Miss Scarlett  wouldn't hurt a fly!"</p><p>"Oh," Mrs Peacock said. "In an evil hour, I erred."</p><hr>
<p>With the utmost composure, Mrs White stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Mrs White called Mrs Peacock into the kitchen.</p><p>Mrs White said, "Mrs Peacock, it needs no great play of imagination to see that it was Professor Plum in the kitchen with the knife!"</p><p>In utter exasperation, Mrs Peacock answered, "Ordinary prudence would suggest that the murder couldn't have taken place in the kitchen. It would have taken far too much effort to move the body from there."</p><p>"Oh," Mrs White said. "I am hardly presentable for polite society."</p><hr>
<p>With the utmost composure, Miss Scarlett stepped into the study.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Miss Scarlett called Mr Green into the study.</p><p>Miss Scarlett said, "Mr Green, I asseverate that it was Mrs Peacock in the study with the knife!"</p><p>With the most astonishing perverseness, Mr Green answered, "Ordinary prudence would suggest that it wasn't Mrs Peacock. Mrs Peacock  wouldn't hurt a fly!"</p><p>"Oh," Miss Scarlett said. "I should not have intruded on you at this hour."</p><hr>
<p>Eager for the fray, Professor Plum stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>Two others already occupied the room. Mrs Peacock was checking inside the cupboards. Mrs White was muttering softly. </p><p>Professor Plum said, "Mrs Peacock, it has been avouched again and again that it was Mr Green in the kitchen with the candlestick!"</p><p>Irritably self-conscious, Mrs Peacock answered, "You have parted company with the facts. Obviously the murder weapon isn't the candlestick. The cause of death was not a blunt object."</p><p>"Oh," Professor Plum said. "If hearty sorrow be a sufficient ransom for offence, I tender’t here."</p><hr>
<p>Without the flick of an eyelid, Colonel Mustard stepped into the lounge.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Colonel Mustard called Professor Plum into the lounge.</p><p>Colonel Mustard said, "Professor Plum, few events are better attested than that it was Mr Green in the lounge with the knife!"</p><p>With a heart as heavy as lead, Professor Plum answered, "The worst wheel always creaks most. Obviously the murder couldn't have taken place in the lounge. That's not where the body was."</p><p>"Oh," Colonel Mustard said. "If hearty sorrow be a sufficient ransom for offence, I tender’t here."</p><hr>
<p>With more than a languid interest, Mr Green stepped into the hall.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Mr Green called Mrs White into the hall.</p><p>Mr Green said, "Mrs White, it requires no extraordinary perception to discern that it was you in the hall with the knife!"</p><p>Irritably self-conscious, Mrs White answered, "That was rather tall talk upon your part. Clearly the murder weapon isn't the knife. There was no blood!"</p><p>"Oh," Mr Green said. "I did not feel that I was committing an indiscretion when I said so."</p><p>Mrs White shot Mr Green an aggrieved look.</p><hr>
<p>With magnificent reserve, Mrs Peacock stepped into the library.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Mrs Peacock called Colonel Mustard into the library.</p><p>Mrs Peacock said, "Colonel Mustard, all competent evidence points to the fact that it was Mr Green in the library with the lead pipe!"</p><p>In utter exasperation, Colonel Mustard answered, "Ordinary prudence would suggest that the murder weapon isn't the lead pipe. The cause of death was not a blunt object."</p><p>"Oh," Mrs Peacock said. "I am hardly presentable for polite society."</p><hr>
<p>With magnificent reserve, Mrs White stepped into the conservatory.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Mrs White called Miss Scarlett into the conservatory.</p><p>Mrs White said, "Miss Scarlett, I am told by persons considering themselves sagacious in business that it was Mrs Peacock in the conservatory with the lead pipe!"</p><p>Irritably self-conscious, Miss Scarlett answered, "No intelligent man can afford to disregard that it wasn't Mrs Peacock.

Professor Plum was humming a tune. </p><p>Miss Scarlett said, "Professor Plum, a reasonable inference is that it was Mrs White in the lounge with the lead pipe!"</p><p>In a fit of nervous exasperation, Professor Plum answered, "This is not a wise course to follow. Obviously the murder couldn't have taken place in the lounge. That's not where the body was."</p><p>"Oh," Miss Scarlett said. "I find my tongue is too foolhardy."</p><hr>
<p>With an air of quiet, unaffected assurance, Professor Plum stepped into the hall.</p><p>One other already occupied the room. Mr Green was checking under the doormat for clues. </p><p>Professor Plum said, "Mr Green, I have a very clear conviction that it was Colonel Mustard in the hall with the candlestick!"</p><p>Sorely tired, Mr Green answered, "It is well within the bounds of conservative statement to say that it wasn't Colonel Mustard. Colonel Mustard  has an air-tight alibi."</p><p>"Oh," Professor Plum said. "The horrible consciousness has just dawned upon me that I may be mistaken."</p><hr>
<p>Teeming with life, Colonel Mustard stepped into the conservatory.</p><p>One other already occupied the room. Mrs White was pacing back and forth. </p><p>Colonel Mustard said, "Mrs White, I am living in the irresistible conviction that it was me in the conservatory with the revolver!"</p><p>Thin-skinned in the presence of annoyances, Mrs White answered, "I cannot abide swaggerers. Clearly the murder couldn't have taken place in the conservatory. It would have taken far too much effort to move the body from there."</p><p>"Oh," Colonel Mustard said. "Your forgiveness for all these offences is very penitently and humbly invoked."</p><hr>
<p>With the utmost composure, Mr Green stepped into the billiard room.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Mr Green called Miss Scarlett into the billiard room.</p><p>Mr Green said, "Miss Scarlett, there is nothing ambiguous about it: it was Professor Plum in the billiard room with the candlestick!"</p><p>With a heart as heavy as lead, Miss Scarlett answered, "No intelligent man can afford to disregard that the murder couldn't have taken place in the billiard room. That's not where the body was."</p><p>"Oh," Mr Green said. "I find my tongue is too foolhardy."</p><hr>
<p>Tinglingly alive, Mrs Peacock stepped into the billiard room.</p><p>Two others already occupied the room. Miss Scarlett was sitting pensively.

<p>As lively as a thrush, Mrs White stepped into the ballroom.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Mrs White called Mrs Peacock into the ballroom.</p><p>Mrs White said, "Mrs Peacock, it is highly probable that it was me in the ballroom with the candlestick!"</p><p>With the most astonishing perverseness, Mrs Peacock answered, "That is too transparently foolish to fool anybody. Clearly the murder weapon isn't the candlestick. The cause of death was not a blunt object."</p><p>"Oh," Mrs White said. "I am far from being as well informed as you suppose me to be."</p><hr>
<p>Full of business, Miss Scarlett stepped into the lounge.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>Miss Scarlett called Mrs Peacock into the lounge.</p><p>Miss Scarlett said, "Mrs Peacock, the plain unvarnished fact is it was Colonel Mustard in the lounge with the knife!"</p><p>In a fit of nervous exasperation, Mrs Peacock answered, "A conclusion not to be accepted without long deliberation.

<p>On a furious march with sealed orders, Professor Plum stepped into the lounge.</p><p>Two others already occupied the room. Miss Scarlett was lounging on a chaise. Mrs Peacock was pacing back and forth. </p><p>Professor Plum said, "Miss Scarlett, there is a phase of the discussion going on which says it was Mr Green in the lounge with the revolver!"</p><p>With unquestioning faith, Miss Scarlett replied, "You have my unqualified approval."</p><hr>

<p>Miss Scarlett called everyone to gather together and began to speak: "I cannot help suspecting. My solution is beyond all dispute. Truly this crime was the most exasperating of all nuisances. This whole time I have had an uncertain sense of something hidden. The murderer must even now be driven into nervous prostration--"</p><p>"Excuse me," broke in Professor Plum. "Are you going to tell us who actually did it?"</p><p>"Why, haven't I said already?" asked Miss Scarlett. "It was Mrs White in the study with the revolver!"</p>
